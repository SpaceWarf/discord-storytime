# Meowtron 6000

The custom bot for the KittyCatFriends Discord server. It has a set of features for user engagement and streamer visibility. Very much a WIP, more features will be added as the need for them arises.

### Storytime
These commands will display "animated" messages in the server.

**!list**: List all the available stories.  
**!story**: Watch a nice story.  

### Twitch
These commands help bring visibility our stream team. Meowtron also notifies the server when channels in this list come online.

**!live**: List all the currently live streamers.  
**!streams**: List all the streamers (live or not).

### Other
These commands aim to improve user engagements within the server as well as meme quality.

**!pep <count>**: Emulate that stupid bitch. Default count is 1 with a max of 5.  
**!pep8**: Same as the pep command, but with a single yes/no/maybe answer.
**!frumpkin <count>**: Because we all need frumpkin in our lives. Default count is 1 with a max of 5. Don't forget to summon him with a snap.
